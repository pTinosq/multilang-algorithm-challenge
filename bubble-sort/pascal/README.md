# Running this algorithm

For Pascal I used the Free Pascal Compiler (fpc) to compile the code.
Available at: https://www.freepascal.org/download.html

```bash
fpc .\main.pas
```

```bash
.\main.exe
```

I also wanted to thank https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pascal/index for being one of the best resources I found to learn Pascal.
